            Located in the heart of Halifax, the Spatz Theatre replaces the Queen Elizabeth
            High School and St. Patâ€™s High School auditoriums. This innovative performance facility will
            be a critical resource for Halifax Regional Municipality, giving the community access to a state-of-the-art
            venue for a wide range of cultural, political and social activities.

            The mission of the Society is to promote arts and culture through the operation,
            management and promotion of the Spatz Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia while balancing
            the interests of Citadel High School and the larger community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our purpose is to inform, inspire and acknowledge the greater community in assisting to
            open the doors of the Spatz Theatre. Through the help of the Citadel Theatre Society,
            the Citadel High Legacy Campaign and the Halifax Regional Municipality we have committed to
            developing a first class theatre for educational and community use.
