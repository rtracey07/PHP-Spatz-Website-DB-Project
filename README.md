# PHP/DB Project - Spatz Theatre Website

The objective of the project was to create database modelling the requirements of a business or system. The objective also included the creation of a user interface which limited the access and manipulation of a created database, based on user access privileges. 

To achieve this, I chose to create a website that acts as the front-end interface of a database. I created an interface that controls employee information, schedules, and rental requests of the local Spatz Theatre. I created the database to house this information, based on the business requirements of the theatre.


There were three types of users: potential renters, employees, and administrators. Each user was restricted to access only the information required to them:

- Renters are able to submit rental request forms.

- Administrators are able to confirm or delete forms; modify employee jobs and wages; and
assign administrator privileges to other employees.

- Employees can access and edit their account information and see their upcoming event
schedule.


The project database was implemented using Sequel Pro. The Website was designed in the PHP scripting language. The project was hosted locally, utilizing the MAMP software bundle and web interface.
